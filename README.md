Case Challenge - Website Funnel Analysis 

# Description of the Challenge 

You are looking at data from an e-commerce website. The site is very simple and has just 4 pages:

1. The first page is the home page. When you come to the site for the first time, you can only land on the home page as a first page.
2. From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page.
3. From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, she will get to the payment page, where she is asked to provide payment information in order to buy that product.
4. If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the confirmation page.

The company CEO isn't very happy with the volume of sales and, especially, of sales coming from new users. Therefore, she asked you to investigate whether there is something wrong in the conversion funnel or, in general, if you could suggest how conversion rate can be improved.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to give insights to the CEO on the issues of the conversion funnel and some strategies that we can follow to improve it.

We are sending you five different files, assume this is data for one day of operations:

1. Home_page_table.csv - information on who landed on the home page
2. Search_page_table.csv  - information on who landed on the search page
3. Payment_page_table.csv - information on who landed on the payment page
4. Payment_confirmation_table.csvn  - information on who landed on the confirmation page
5. User_table.csv - information about users
